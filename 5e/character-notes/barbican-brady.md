* Red Gem: Wizard - "Ah, the Master of Stars the card of a great wizard. Wise men are not wise at all times. Seek the lone tower for your answer to the location of the Red Gem"
* Green Gem: Raven - "The Raven Card, how interesting. Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore. Quoth the Raven, nevermore. Not all creatures are what they seem."

Fanes Notes:
Posessing: Fanes of barovia phamphleth

Summary:
* First there were Mountain, Forest, and Water fey in the valley. The fey and their druids fought off dark powers and kept the valley in check. 
* Then there were kings and the morning lord. The walls of the towns and light of the morning lord separated the people from nature and the fey and druids receded.
* Strahd arrived and conquered the valley. He chased off the Morning Lord and invited in the dark powers once held in cheque by the druids. 
* The Fey created an artifact, 'The Heart of Sorrow' to purify Strahd's heart. The water fey attempted to deliver it to him as a gift. 
    * The Water fey was captured. She escaped, but has since has become corrupted and is now known as Baba Lysaga in the swamps. 
    * The Mountain fey left their gem with a wizard, possibly Khazan and went out in search of someone who could help. 
    * The Forest fey left their gem with were ravens and embedded themselves with the vistani.
